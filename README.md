## What is ASP.NET Identity?

ASP.NET Identity is a user management framework integrated into ASP.NET. It provides essential features like user registration, password management, role-based access control, and integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

---

## Key Features

1. **Extensibility**:  
   - Fully customizable to meet specific application needs.
2. **Role Management**:  
   - Allows defining roles and assigning users to them for fine-grained access control.
3. **Claims-Based Authentication**:  
   - Supports claims-based security for flexible user identity management.
4. **Integration with External Providers**:  
   - Works with OAuth and OpenID Connect for third-party authentication.
5. **Password Hashing**:  
   - Implements industry-standard secure password hashing mechanisms.
6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  
   - Built-in support for enhancing security.
7. **Scalability**:  
   - Can scale for large user bases in enterprise-level applications.
8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
   - Works across Windows, macOS, and Linux with ASP.NET Core.

## How ASP.NET Identity Works

1. **Authentication**:  
   - Verifies user credentials and issues secure authentication cookies or tokens.
2. **Authorization**:  
   - Defines and enforces access control policies based on roles or claims.
3. **Identity Management**:  
   - Manages user data and custom claims for personalization.
4. **Integration**:  
   - Easily integrates with existing databases and external identity providers.
